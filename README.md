# DAT250: Experiment Assignment 2.

- [X]  Experiment 1: Application using JPA
- [X]  Experiment 2: Banking/Credit Card example JPA

## Experiment 1: Application using JPA
I started with cloning the maven projec and changed the connection string to the following:

`                      
<property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.url" value="jdbc:derby:C:\Source\assignment2\todoDb;create=true"/>
`

I then installed derby database, and began with step 4.3 in the tutorial.

By doing so, I created a couple of todo items in the database. I edited the todo description to include my name, and summary to include my lastname. 

`todo.setSummary("This is a test by Ayoub");`


`todo.setDescription("Tammaoui");`

These were created by running the Main class:

I managed to visualize them in Intellij by connecting to the derby database (using my new connection string) and executing the SQL query:

`select * from TODO`

## Experiment 2: Banking/Credit Card example JPA

### 1. Domain model
A domain model created of the java classes using Intellij. The model also shows the relations between the objects.

### 2. Persist object into database. ChecK links are saved correctly
By viewing in the image below, we see the tables.

By fetching the Person rows after having created them (created them similar to how the todo objects were created) and using Intellijs database UI to display them:
`select * FROM  PERSON`

We can also see it here that the links are saved correctly by inspecting the objects in the JPA structure in Intellij:

## After having added support for ManyToMany relations, we get the following domain model:

The following tables were created:

We now have more tables that represent the relation between the entities such as ADRESS_PERSON. The table ADRESS_PERSON represents the relation between a person and a address
so that a user can have multiple addresses.

This is also reflected when a user is printed in the console:

`
Person{name='Ayoub Tammaoui', creditCards=[CreditCard{id=104, number=1231, balance=5000, limit=10000, bank=Bank{id=103, Name='DNB'}, pinCode=PinCode{id=102, count=10, pinCode='0'}}], addresses=[Address{id=101, street='VÃ¥gsallmenningen'}]}
`


Issues:
- I managed to extend class Person with Address (by autoformatting with Intellij without being aware) and took me a lot of time to figure why the Person entity didnt
get created.
- I was not aware of that a Person was to have a ManyToMany relation with credit cards and addresses. This is now added and shown in the last part of the assignment.
